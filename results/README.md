<b>Reading results:</b>
<br>To read the results from the pickle files, we recommend using the following command in a Jupyter Notebook:

<code>import pandas as pd
obj = pd.read_pickle("filename.pkl")
</code>

After this, you can read an object entry at the index (ex: obj[0]) or loop through the object to read multiple/all entries.
