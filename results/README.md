<b>Reading results:</b>
<br>To read the results from the pickle files, we recommend using the following command in a Jupyter Notebook:

<code>import pandas as pd
obj = pd.read_pickle("filename.pkl")
</code>

After this, you can read an object entry at the index (ex: obj[0]) or loop through the object to read multiple/all entries.

You will be able to see the word the transformer deems as the correction as well as the array of correction possibilities provided by the transformer in some files. We hope you find our results interesting!
